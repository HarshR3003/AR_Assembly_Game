The aim of the project is to build an Assembly game using AR. The object consists of 9 blocks assembled like a rubix cube. It uses a tap to place button functionality and transform function of C# to 
move the vertices, edges , centre, faces outwards to disassemble and inwards to assemble.
It is a fun 1 player game where the player first clicks on the bulb shaped button to know the contents of the game and then learns the assembly and applies it.

It the player arranges the blocks in wrong assembly then a prompt is generated saying" Wrong Assembly".

Once the player is able to arrange all the blocks in the correct order, the game ends:
